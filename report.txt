Files can still be compiled by running the make command,
note: the names have not been changed...although MPI has been implemented.

A graph of the data, along with the data can be found in data-graph.png

The original serial version ran at 10.6s.

Summary of the code: We broke up the for loop into seperate processes and used the MPI_REDUCTION to
copy back to the loop, using a local version of the array.  We used MPI_COMM for size and world to
break up the array indices.

Speedups for 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 48 processes on 1 compute node:
2: 15.6s
4: 10.5s
8: 8.1s
16: 7.7s
32: 2.5s
48: 4.1s

The best speedups achievable from using 2 Nodes from 2 to 96 are:
2: 6.1s
4: 4.5s
8: 3.6s
16: 2.9s
32: 5.9s
48: 4.1s
64: 3.6s
96: 2.6s

This shows that both 16 and 96 are the fastest, with 64 and 8 not far behind.
