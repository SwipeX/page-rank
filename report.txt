Files can still be compiled by running the make command,
note: the names have not been changed...although MPI has been implemented.

Speedups for 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 48 processes on 1 compute node:
2: 15.6s
4: 10.5s
8: 8.1s
16: 7.7s
32: 2.5s
48: 

The best speedups achievable from using 2 Nodes from 2 to 96 are:
2: 6.1
4: 4.5
8: 3.6
16: 2.9
32: 5.9
48: 
64: 
96: 2.6
